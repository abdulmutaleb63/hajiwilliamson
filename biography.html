    <h2>The Life of Haji Williamson</h2>

    <p>Few areas in Britain have produced as many notable families in world history. The family name Williamson is one of those. It is believed to be descended originally from the Strathclyde Britons .  This ancient founding race of the north were a mixture of Gaelic/Celts whose original territories ranged from Lancashire in the south, northward to the south bank of the River Clyde in Scotland . There were many notable contemporaries of this name Williamson; and one of the most notable was William Richard Williamson,  </p>

    <p>The Arabian adventurer.</p>

    <p>High spirits sometimes led him to high places, the favorite eminence being the Clifton suspension bridge, that lofty and graceful structure spanning the Avon gorge.</p>

    <p>Williamson was born in Bristol in 1872, and when still a boy demonstrated a rebellious nature that sat easily with a passionate hatred of injustice. While a pupil at Clifton School he repeatedly courted both danger and the ire of headmasters by climbing the famous Clifton suspension bridge which soars over the Avon gorge. He was overjoyed when an uncle found him a place on a tea-clipper bound for Australia . The family’s hope was that the rigors of shipboard life would soon cause the thirteen-year old to pine for the comparative comforts of a boarding school. But the new ship’s boy was flogged and regularly mast headed’ for his lubber’s clumsiness in Biscay gales, he resolved never to return.</p>

    <p>A boy living in Bristol in the eighties needed no salt in the blood to stimulate his interest in the sea</p>

    <p>The barque landed its cargo in New South Wales , and set course for Bristol via San Diego . Ashore in the Californian port, the ship’s mates scattered in the traditional quest for beer and beauty. Williamson, however, clutching two dollars, took French leave’, and ran inland, praying that he would not be spotted by his shipmates, who were likely to force him back on board. He found work on a farm just south of Los Angeles , and then worked for his Aunt Amy, who had married a local homesteader.  she came to admire her nephew, who soon mastered all the usual cowboy skills, including gun-slinging and bronco-breaking, but refused to accompany the other ranch-hands on their regular busts’ in the vice-dens of neighboring towns. Receptive to California ‘s natural beauty, he had developed a strong belief in God, and a dislike for throwing away what slender financial means he possessed.</p>
